Findings of IoT4Bees-Ctrl
=========================


- PCB-board house: use ENIG instead of HASL
- PMIC 1.2V: try to find another chip with these features but other package
- PMIC 1.2V: move towards the center of the board (reflow wind turbulences at the edges)
- Power switch: U1801 - do not use IC above 3.3V, use (MOS)FETs instead
- Power switch: every enable for those power switches to be pulled down by 2M ohms.
- Put 100nF to each IC power pin, not to far away from those pins
